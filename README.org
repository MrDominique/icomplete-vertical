* icomplete-vertical

This is a simple-minded global minor mode to comfortably use
icomplete to display completion candidates vertically. A simple
=(setq icomplete-separator "\n")= gets you 95% of the way there, this
small package just adds a few visual tweaks on top of that.

Specifically, simply setting the separator to a newline has two issues
which this package addresses:

1. Usually the minibuffer prompt and the text you type scroll off to
   the left!
2. The first candidate appears in the same line as you are typing, not
   below it lined up with the other candidates.

* Installation and usage

For now, put =icomplete-vertical.el= somewhere in your =load-path=, and
=require= it. Turn the minor mode on or off with =M-x
icomplete-vertical-mode=.

(Personally, I can't decide whether I prefer icomplete horizontally or
vertically, so I bound =icomplete-vertical-mode= to a key and go back
and forth indecisively.)

You can configure how tall you want the minibuffer during completion
by customizing the variable =icomplete-vertical-prospects-height=. This
is a separate variable from =icomplete-prospects-height= because if you
use icomplete both horizontally and vertically you are likely to want
different values for the two settings.

* Screenshots

This is what =describe-function= looks like in =icomplete-vertical-mode=
(with Protesilaos Stavrou's [[https://gitlab.com/protesilaos/modus-themes][lovely modus-operandi theme]]):

For comparison this is what simply setting =icomplete-separator= to ="\n"= looks like:

[[./describe-function-just-sep.png]]

Notice the missing prompt and text typed so far (=icom=), and how the
first candidate (=icomplete-tidy=) is on the line where you type.
